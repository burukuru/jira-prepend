Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
Assuming you have Vundle installed and configured, the following steps will install the plugin:

Add the following line to your `~/.vimrc` and then run `:PluginInstall` from within Vim:

``` vim
call vundle#begin()
" ...
Plugin 'mshirlaw/jira-prepend'
" ...
call vundle#end()
```
